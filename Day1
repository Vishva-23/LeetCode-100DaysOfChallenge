# Day 1: Linked List Code Practice

## Goal

The primary goal of today's practice session is to gain a solid understanding of Linked Lists and sharpen my problem-solving skills with regards to Linked List manipulation. I will be working on various Linked List problems provided by LeetCode to improve my algorithmic thinking and programming techniques.

## Conclusion

Day 1 of the 100 Days of LeetCode practice journey has been focused on Linked List challenges. I had a great time tackling these problems and implementing the Linked List data structure. Tomorrow, I will continue the coding practice with a new set of challenges, possibly exploring other data structures or algorithmic concepts.

Thank you for following my progress! Happy coding! ðŸš€
